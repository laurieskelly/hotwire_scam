### **True confessions** I was tricked by a Hotwire scam: *the "hot rate hotel" story*

This is the place where I will tell you the story about how hotwire.com uses language, typography, and UX to scam their customers into unloading their lowest-quality inventory in the belief that they are getting an amazing deal on a higher-priced hotel. They did it to me and I want my money back. 

If you are a lawyer and believe that hotwire.com is crossing legal lines as well as those of poor taste, please contact me. 

### The ol' Cloak and Double Dagger
Look at the image below, specifically at the two places where the $489 figure is crossed out. You might think this is saying "The price is usually $489+" ($489 or more!? this must be a pretty swanky mystery hotel), and the strikethrough indicates that this Hotel has a Hot Rate that is much lower than it usually is. We're familiar with this visual language. It indicates a sale.

If you look at the right side, (under the stars) you can notice a small separation between the crossed-out number and the plus sign, but on the right under "standard price" the line is completely continuous through all of the symbols. The eagle-eyed consumer might have noticed the gap and gone to the foot of the page for a disclaimer. The woman at the call center called it an asterisk (*), but it's a [double dagger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(typography)) (â€¡). The double dagger is a symbol that is used to direct a reader to a footnote, but in this case you can't deny that it drastically reduces the chance that the visitor will notice and do so. 

### The footnote

Ok, so if you do go down to the footnote, you get this:

Which, if you were thinking in the terms of a sale price / discounted price, would be pretty confusing, regardless. I am pretty sure that I would have gotten it if I had seen the footnote. But hindsight is 20/20. It was in fact explained to me by the customer service agent when I called to ask why they had implied that the Standard Rate at the Holiday Inn Express Brooklyn was $489. She showed me the "asterisk" (double dagger) that explains the "discount" (difference in cost between a shitty hotel in a nice neighborhood and the nice hotels that are around it). 

### So what is a "Hot Rate Hotel"? 

Now I know that a "Hot Rate Hotel" is a hotel whose prices are drastically below other hotels in the same neighborhood at the same star rating. A.k.a., a Hot Rate Hotel is the shittiest hotel around. Because, I'm sure, no one wants to stay in a shitty hotel in a nice area, hotwire had to get creative and scam us into thinking we were getting a great rate at a fancy hotel. Instead, you're a chump with a regular rate at the Holiday Inn Express Brooklyn. 

I hope that unloading these "Hot Load Hotel" rooms is extremely high priority to hotwire, because I can't imagine anyone using their site again after suffering the insult of falling for this scam.
